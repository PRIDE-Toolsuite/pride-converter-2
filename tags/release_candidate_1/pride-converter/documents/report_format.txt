mzdata-spectrum
---------------
- can provide a count of all included spectra
- either include all spectra or only identied ones. Anything else will be handled
  by pride filter tool
- keep in mind that DAO should be able to deal with fully-built spectrum object

----
- accession
- source database
- mass delta (*)
- fixed/variable (*)

==============================================================================

after pre-scan, report file would contain fasta sequences of all identifications
in a block that can be referered to from individual identifications

<fasta>
  <sequence id=1 accession="P12345">
    ILIKEPIE
  </sequence>
  ...
</fasta>


identifications
----------------
  - quantitative shit
  - 2D shit
  - additional crap
  - protein inference - whitelist of peptides
  - boolean flags
    - provides fragment ion annotation
    - provides quantitative information
    - has 2D coordinates
    - more?
