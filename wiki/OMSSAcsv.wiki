#summary Documentation of the OMSSA-csv DAO from PRIDE Converter 2.

= Introduction =

The Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm [OMSSA] is an efficient search engine for identifying MS/MS peptide spectra by searching libraries of known protein sequences. OMSSA scores significant hits with a probability score developed using classical hypothesis testing, the same statistical method used in BLAST. OMSSA is free and in the public domain. Detailed information can be found at http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/.

Currently, the *XTandem DAO* supports spectra in PKL, DTA, MGF, MZXML, MS2, and MZML formats.

= Parameters =

 * *Threshold*: The maximum expect value a peptide may have to still be included in the PRIDE XML file. All peptides with an expect value greater than the set threshold will be ignored. Default value is _0.0_.

 * *Fixed PTMs*: a user defined collection of fixed PTMs in the format <delta_value>@<aminoacid> and comma separated. Default list contains 57.02@C.

 * *Variable PTMs*: a user defined collection of fixed PTMs in the format <delta_value>@<aminoacid> and comma separated. Default list contains 15.99@M.
