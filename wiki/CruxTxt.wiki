#summary Documentation of the Crux-txt DAO from PRIDE Converter 2

= Introduction =

Crux is a software toolkit for tandem mass spectrometry analysis, with a focus on peptide identification. Crux implements the Sequest algorithm and accelerates the search using a regenerated index file.

More information can be found at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/crux/

Currently, the *Crux-txt DAO* supports spectra in _MS2 format_ only.

= Parameters =

*Threshold*: The maximum expect value a peptide may have to still be included in the PRIDE XML file. All peptides with an expect value greater than the set threshold will be ignored. Default value is _0.0_.

*Decoy Prefix*: allows adding a prefix to decoy hits that will be included in the Pride XML file.

*Score Criteria*: the score criteria used to apply the Threshold filter. Default value is _xcorr_rank_.

*Get Highest Score Item*: if true, only the highest scored peptide for a given spectrum will be included in the Pride XML file. Default value is _true_.

= Details =

* *PTMs*: Post-translational modifications are specified in the peptide sequence (variable modifications) and in the parameter file (variable modifications, fixed modifications, and terminal modifications).
