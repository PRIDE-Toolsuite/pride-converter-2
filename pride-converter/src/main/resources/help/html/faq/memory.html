            Although PRIDE Inspector is design to handle large data sets with small memory footprint, it can still run
            out of memory if many files or public experiments are opened at the same time. If you have seen such a
            warning message in a pop-up window, you should try to increase the memory allocation for the program.This
            can be done by editing the config.props file, this file is located in the config folder of the installation
            directory.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the file, change the <b>pride.inspector.max.memory=1024</b> to a higher number, for instance,
            <b>pride.inspector.max.memory=2048</b> will give PRIDE Inspector 2G of memory. Please note that you will
            need to
            restart PRIDE Inspector in order for the change to take effect. It is also important to know that on a
            32-bit operating system you can not increase this value beyond 2000.
