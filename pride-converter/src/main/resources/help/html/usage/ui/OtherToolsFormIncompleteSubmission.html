            We recommend that your files are checked thoroughly before submission to PRIDE using <a
                href="http://code.google.com/p/pride-toolsuite/downloads/list">PRIDE Inspector</a>.
            PRIDE Inspector is a desktop application to visualize and
            perform an initial quality assessment on MS experiments. <a

        <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            You can submit your PRIDE XML files containing peptide/protein identifications and your
            mass spectrometry raw files via PRIDE to the ProteomeXchange consortium.
            The PX consortium has been set up to provide a single point of submission of
            MS proteomics data to the main proteomics repositories, and encourage the data
            exchange between them so that the community may easily benefit.
            You can <a href="http://www.proteomexchange.org/">download the PX submission tool</a>
            and we suggest trying out the Complete Submission option, which provides a built-in FTP upload capacity.

        <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            In case you haven't or couldn't provided protein/peptide identification
            information in your PRIDE XML files a Complete PX Submission is not possible. You should select
            the Partial Submission option. You may provide the identification information at a later
            time to upgrade your submission to "Complete" status.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            PRIDE XML files are a limited representation of your results, but within a PX submission, you
            can provide other result or identification files, as well as the raw MS files that can be mapped to
            your PRIDE XML files to provide as complete a represented as possible.
            The biggest advantage of doing a PX submission is that a DOI will be
            assigned to your dataset, providing a stable identifier across all repositories.
