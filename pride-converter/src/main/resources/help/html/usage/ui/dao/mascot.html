    <p>The PRIDE Converter 2 Mascot DAO is build based on the Mascot
        Parser from Matrix Science
        (http://www.matrixscience.com/msparser.html). A complete

                    Significant identifications are determined using the set <b>Min
                        Probability</b> on the Identity Threshold. There is no clear
                    suggestion whether only the Identity Threshold or also the

                    reported. The correct charge state is always additionally reported

        <h3>Details</h3>

        <p>To convert Mascot results into PRIDE XML files several
            compromises have to be taken:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ion Series:</b> Mascot supports the possibility to query
                spectra where the ion series (b, y, rest) are separated beforehand.
                These cases are currently not supported by the Mascot DAO and only
                ionSeries 1 (as recommende in the Mascot Parser documentation) is
                taken into consideration. This should work fine for 99% of cases.
            </li>
            <li><b>Precursor Charge States:</b> There is currently only one
                precursor supported per spectrum. Furthermore, as Mascot can report
                multiple peptides per spectrum the Mascot DAO only reports charge
                states at the peptide level and NOT at the precursor level.
            </li>
            <li><b>Unsupported PRIDE XML objects:</b> The following objects
                are currently not supported (and thus not returned) by the Mascot
                DAO:
                <ul>
                    <li>Activation parameter</li>
                    <li>Spectrum acquisition parameters</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Error tolerant searches:</b> The Mascot DAO currently
                only supports integrated error tolerant searches. Separate error
                tolerant searches are not recommended by Matrix Science and thus
                are not supported.
            </li>
            <li><b>Quantitation Methods:</b> Quantitation methods are not
                supported by the Mascot DAO directly. As defined in the PRIDE
                Converter 2 introduction it is possible to report quantitative
                values using additional mzTab files.
            </li>
            <li><b>PMF:</b> In PMF searches all queries are reported as 1
                MS1 spectrum. In case no intensities are supplied to the search all
                peak intensities are set to 1. The spectra then all point to the
                same one spectrum. Additionally, every peptide contains one
                additional m/z parameter storing the m/z value the peptide was
                identified from.
            </li>
            <li><b>Protein families:</b> Protein families (available from
                Mascot version >= 2.3) cannot be reported in PRIDE XML files.
                Therefore, the here presented results correspond to the results
                seen in the older "peptide summary" view.
            </li>
            <li><b>Protein scores in MudPIT experiments:</b> For several
                reasons when using MudPIT scoring, proteins with only one peptide
                can have a lower score than the threshold while still being deemed
                significant identifications. this is caused by the fact that the
                protein thresholds have to be determined by using the average
                peptide threshold in the file (as recommended in the Mascot Parser
                documentation).
