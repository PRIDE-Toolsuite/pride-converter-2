            <h2>PRIDE XML Export</h2>

            <p>
                PRIDE Converter 2 can generate compressed files using the gzip algorithm to save on disk space. This is
                enabled by default, as is the option to remove any temporary work files, such as report files, once the
                application exits. PRIDE Converter 2 will always include all spectra in the generated PRIDE XML file
                unless
                the “include only identified” spectra option is selected. If the experiment contains interaction data
                that
                would benefit from being submitted to the IntAct interaction database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact) at
                the
                EBI, users are encouraged to select the relevant option in the export dialog. This will add a CV term in
                the
                generated XML file that will be recognized by the submission process and the person whose contact
                details
                have been captured will be contacted by an IntAct curator for further discussion.
            </p>

            <h2>PRIDE XML Filtering</h2>

            <p>
                The <b>“include only identified spectra”</b> filter is the only filter that does not need to generate an
                intermediate PRIDE XML file, as this can be done at the DAO level. All other filters will first write a
                complete PRIDE XML file, as normal, then post-process this file to generate the fully-filtered PRIDE XML
                file. This will have consequences on the time and disk space required to fully produce the final file.
            </p>

            <p>

                The <b>“remove empty spectra”</b> filter will remove any spectra that do not contain any peaks. The
                “remove
                identification with less than X peptides” filter will scan and remove any protein identification from
                the PRIDE XML file that contains less peptides than the number given as parameter.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>“remove selected identifications”</b> filter requires a list of contaminant protein
                identifications in
                the form of a text file with one protein accession per line. It will use this blacklist to remove
                corresponding identifications from the XML file where the submitted protein accession identically
                matches one of the blacklisted protein identifiers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>“use protein inference results”</b> filter also requires a list of protein identifications in the
                same
                manner as the previous filter but works in the complete opposite fashion. Only identifications found in
                the whitelist are retained in the final PRIDE XML file.
            </p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>

            <p>
                Generating the PRIDE XML files can take anywhere between minutes and hours. This is proportional to the
                size, number and complexity of the source files. Users should ensure that they have sufficient disk
                space. If filtering is enabled, the full PRIDE XML file is first written to disk, then written again in
                its filtered form after it has been processed. The report file and the intermediate PRIDE XML file are
                only deleted when PRIDE Converter 2 exits if the “remove temporary files” option is selected.
