#About PRIDE Converter 2
The PRIDE Converter 2 tool suite is a composed of 4 independent applications:

The PRIDE Converter 2 application will convert MS search result files containing identification and spectra into PRIDE XML.

The PRIDE mzTab Generator will produce skeleton mzTab files from MS search results files. These skeleton files require either manual or scripted editing to add quantitation and/or gel information.

The PRIDE XML Filter will remove identifications or spectra from PRIDE XML files based on a series of configurable filters.

The PRIDE XML Merger will combine several PRIDE XML files into a single one.

All tools have both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI). The GUIs have been designed to provide a rich, user-friendly interface while the CLIs have been developed mainly for tool and pipeline developers to be able to integrate the PRIDE Converter 2 tools in their own software to provide an efficient way to generate PRIDE XML from their own resources.
