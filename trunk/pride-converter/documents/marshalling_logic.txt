- identificationIterator               - reportformatidentificationiterator
- always returns n identifications     - returns m <= n identifications
- alwyas returns n in the same         - no guarantee on order whatsoever
  order for a given method
  in a search result file

      Marshaller to output xml will
      - iterate on source file using IdIter
          - for each identification
              - lookup in report file
              - resolve conflicting data based on report file
              - update identification with spectrum ref, additional params, etc
              - marshall to output file


Need SpectrumResolver that will work in two modes
  - output all spectra
  - output only identified spectra
     - need then mechanism to provide whitelist of peptide UIDs
  - need mechanism to resolve spectrumRef for peptide UID in both modes
