        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">

        <h2>The Application Selector window appears but no tools start when a button is clicked</h2>

        <p>When PRIDE Converter 2 starts in the GUI mode, the first screen that is displayed is the application selector
            In rare occasions, it is possible that nothing happens when the users click on a button to start
            a specific application (Converter, Filter, Merger, mzTab generator). This is generally a problem caused with
            improper Java configuration. Please ensure that JAVA_HOME is correctly set in your environment and that the
            java runtime executable file is in your path. Please refer to the Java documentation on how to properly
            install and configure the Java Runtime Environment (http://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml).

        <p>When a button is clicked from the application selector, a new process is launched based on the settings found
            in the converter.properties file that is located in the same directory as the PRIDE Converter 2 jar file.

        #set the exact path of the java executable if not already in the path
        #do not include the executable itself and include a trailing slash
        #eg java.home=/home/rcote/dev/jdk1.6.0_13/bin/
        #and not #eg java.home=/home/rcote/dev/jdk1.6.0_13/bin/java
        java.home=

        # any JVM argument listed here will be passed verbatim to the JVM
        jvm.args=-Xms128M -Xmx4000M

        # uncomment and set accordingly to configure PROXY settings
        #http.proxyHost=webcache.mydomain.com
        #http.proxyPort=8080
        #http.proxyUser=
        #http.proxyPassword=
        #http.proxySet=true
</pre>

        <p>If JAVA_HOME isnâ€™t properly set, the new process might not properly start. One way to circumvent this problem
            is to update the java.home setting in the properties file. You need to include the full path to the java
            executable, including the final slash, but do not include the java application itself.

<pre>
        java.home=/home/rcote/dev/jdk1.6.0_13/bin/ - correct for linux and Mac OS X
        java.home=c:\Program Files\jdk1.6.0_13\bin\ - correct for Windows
</pre>

        <p>If this still does not work correctly, try starting PRIDE Converter 2 from the command line, as useful
            debugging information is logged to the console window.

        <h2>A progress window appears but the application seems to hang</h2>

        <p>If you are converting a large number of files or files that are very big or contain a large number of
            spectra, the conversion process can take anywhere from minutes to hours. This is normal and the time
            required will be in direct proportion to the number, size and complexity of the source files. The GUI
            will always show message dialogs if exceptions occur. If the application still seems to hang but no error
            message is shown, users should look in the log file that is in the log directory where the PRIDE Converter
            2 was installed.

        <h2>The application runs out of memory</h2>

        The PRIDE Converter 2 tool suite was written to be as memory-efficient as possible. However, if converting a
        large number of big files, it is always possible to run out of memory. If this should happen, please update
        the <i>jvm.args</i> setting in the <i>converter.properties</i> file.

        <h2> The application cannot use the OLS</h2>

        <p>The PRIDE Converter 2 tool suite requires a working internet connection to connect to the OLS web service to
            perform CV term related queries. If you are on a computer that requires a proxy configuration to access
            external network resources, you will need to uncomment and update the five <i>http.proxy</i> settings in
            the <i>converter.properties</i> file.
